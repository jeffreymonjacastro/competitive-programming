# Commands 

## Create new problem

Syntax:
```bash
python create_problem.py <platform> <contest_id> <problem_name> [difficulty] [tags...]
```
1. `<platform>`: The platform where the problem is hosted (e.g., `codeforces`, `atcoder`).
2. `<contest_id>`: The contest identifier (e.g., `850D2`, `B408`).
3. `<problem_name>`: The name of the problem (e.g., `A-shortest-path`).
4. `[difficulty]`: (Optional) The difficulty of the problem (e.g., `1800`).
5. `[tags...]`: (Optional) A list of tags associated with the problem (e.g., `bfs`, `graphs`).

Example: BFS problem in CodeForces with difficulty and tags
```bash
python create_problem.py codeforces 850D2 A-shortest-path 1800 bfs graphs 
```

This will create:

```
# - platforms/codeforces/contests/850D2/A-shortest-path/
# - topics/graphs/search/BFS.md (if it doesn't exist)
# - topics/graphs/Graph Theory.md (if it doesn't exist)
# - Automatic links between the problem and topics
```

Example: DP problem in AtCoder 
```bash
python create_problem.py atcoder 1200D3 B-Longest-Subsequence
```

This will only create the folder, the .md file, and the .cpp file

```
# - platforms/atcoder/contests/1200D3/B-Longest-Subsequence/
```

## View available tags
```bash
python create_problem.py --list-tags
```

Output:
```
# üè∑Ô∏è Available tags:
# 
# üìÇ Graphs:
#    ‚Ä¢ bfs
#    ‚Ä¢ dfs  
#    ‚Ä¢ dijkstra
#    ‚Ä¢ kruskal
# 
# üìÇ Dynamic-programming:
#    ‚Ä¢ dp
#    ‚Ä¢ knapsack
#    ‚Ä¢ lis
```
